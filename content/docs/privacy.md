## 1. Introduction  
Linutil is an open-source project that provides Linux utilities for system management and optimization. We respect user privacy and do not collect, store, or process any personal data.  

## 2. No Data Collection  
Linutil does not collect, track, or store any user dataâ€”whether personal or system-related. The software runs locally on your system and does not communicate with any external servers.  

## 3. Third-Party Services  
Linutil itself does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or telemetry. However, if you interact with Linutil via GitHub or its documentation website, those platforms may collect data according to their respective privacy policies.  

## 4. Security  
Since Linutil does not collect or store data, there are no security concerns related to user privacy. However, users should ensure they follow best security practices when using open-source software.  

## 5. Changes to This Policy  
Since Linutil does not handle user data, updates to this policy are unlikely. However, if any changes occur, they will be reflected here.
