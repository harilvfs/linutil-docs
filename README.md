## Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) üåê

<p> Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator designed for building modern websites, particularly documentation sites, blogs, and portfolios with ease. </p>

> [!NOTE]
> As you can see, this is a fork of Linutil Docs. However, this site or repository is **not** intended for **official Linutil documentation**.  
> Please refer to the official Linutil documentation for any official reference or modifications.

> [!WARNING]
> Do **not** fork or use this as the official Linutil documentation.  
> This site is quite messy and somewhat hardcoded by the theme developer, [Thulitieo](https://github.com/thuliteio/getdoks.org/).  
> Implementing new features or making modifications won't be easy.

Note that the search functionality is **not working**, and I have no plans to fix it.  
This project was purely created to test the Hugo documentation theme.

After testing, I don't think I'll ever use this again, considering its current state.  
Implementing anything here was an absolute nightmare, so I **do not recommend** forking or modifying it.

That being said, no hate towards the theme developer‚ÄîLove your theme, [Thulitieo](https://github.com/thuliteio/getdoks.org/)!  
However, I don‚Äôt understand why the provided template is vastly different from your documentation site.  
It lacks flexibility, making it difficult to modify anything in the `layout`.

Thank you to Hugo and the developer for this amazing documentation theme, but improvements are definitely needed.  
A more detailed guide for troubleshooting and modifying the theme would be greatly beneficial.

It would be awesome if the developers took note of this.  
And again, no hate‚Äîthis theme is great, but whether it's a **skill issue** on my end or a limitation of the theme, I couldn't achieve what I wanted. :(
